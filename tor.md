# Tor Security Related Info / Stories

QUANTUMINSERT - "Using upstream collection of data, the NSA created a database of Tor users – which is easy to achieve, as by design all Tor clients should look the same. To distinguish individual users QUANTUM analysed each system it detected, and produced software-hardware ‘fingerprints’ of system configuration."

1) It's "self-selecting". With the "pervasive surveillance" that is utilized specifically by the NSA and other entities, entering into the Tor network effectively puts you in a huge network corral.  

2) The low latency usability of the Tor network actually makes monitoring netflow at a high level overview extremely capable of mapping traffic from a source to endpoint through traffic / flow analysis. 

3) Traffic / flow analysis is easier on Tor than say the general internet because there's so little noise or fake traffic because this would stress the limited Tor resources, effect lataency, increase costs, etc.

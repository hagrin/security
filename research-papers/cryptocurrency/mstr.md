# Mircrostrategy (MSTR) Investment Analysis

The following is an attempt to spell out as many angles of the MSTR trade as I possibly can. Warning - I do not feel comfortable writing on this topic because I feel like I maybe understand 90% of it and the last 10% is very likely to hold a lot of value. However, this has been a very requested topic; therefore, I am attempting to create a reference document.<br /><br />

## Core Business

Microstrategy is, at its core, a software / IT services company that remains extremely vital to its bitcoin treasury ambitions. What does the core business give Saylor in his quest to be able to build this bitcoin treasury? A balance sheet.

## Convertible Debt Conversion

Saylor's idea here and the mechanics are the following -
- Issue convertible debt
- At the time of this issue, the conversion is accounted for immeditaely in the "implied outstanding shares"
- By doing it this way, the BTC/ratio already accounts for debt conversion and dilution
- If conversions happen, Saylor intends to just issue more convertible debt to buy more BTC which allow him to continue to acquire more BTC

### Facts

"MSTR was kind enough to confirm that the 130% rule is based on a rolling 30 day period and not a fixed 30 day period in the quarter" - Source: https://x.com/BenWerkman/status/1847368302663716965

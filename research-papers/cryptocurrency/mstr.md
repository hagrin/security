# Mircrostrategy (MSTR) Investment Analysis

The following is an attempt to spell out as many angles of the MSTR trade as I possibly can. I honestly feel like this is one of the more complicated trades around right now because you need to understand the bitcoin markets, the traditional equities market, the bond market, geopolitics and everything else that comes with understanding bitcoin. My belief is that anyone who describes this trade in simplistic terms highly likely doesn't understand how the entire trade functions.

Warning - I do not feel overly comfortable writing on this topic because it <strong>is</strong> one of the most comlpicated trades around right now. However, this has been a very requested topic; therefore, I am attempting to create a reference document. This document attempts to first lay out all of the mechanics behind this trade and then try and offer up some things to think about in terms of price, risk and long-term viability.

Normal financial disclosures - this isn't financial advice and you shouldn't purchase or not purchase MSTR or bitcoin based on anything below. The following is simply an outline of how the parties involved in this trade are behaving and their likely motivations.

## Mission Statement / General Trade Idea

Microstrategy's basic idea is extremely straightfroward - first, raise capital through bond issues or equity offerings to buy bitcoin and create an extensive bitcoin treasury. This step has already been successfully launched and put into practice with bitcoin holdings over 272k BTC (13 Nov 2024). Second, and yet to be made active and is very speculative, is to create a bitcoin based financial services / bank operation so that they can utilize that treasury to earn BTC yield (entirely possible this never materializes). The entire premise can be boiled down to a simple idea - that MSTR is trading ever increasingly devalued fiat in order to accumulate, and never sell, a much harder asset that will continue to gain value versus fiat on long time horizons. What MSTR is executing is akin to a "vampire attack" against the USD (or a speculative attack or a Bitcoin Milkshake scenario) where one alternative tries to attract liquidity, interest and volume from another alternative by being a more attractive alternative. In this scenario the ever increasing purchasing power of bitcoin vs the USD is the attractive incentive to not only buy, but hold the asset.

The non-believer's perspective on this trade idea is that MSTR is trying to sell you their uncapped paper (common stock) so that they can buy BTC instead of you just buying it directly. The non-believer will point to this very obvious cognitive dissonance that if MSTR is only going to be a BTC treasury and not make yield off these holdings that to buy MSTR means you're acting against the ethos of the bitcoin project. What makes this worse is that you may sometimes be paying a multiple for this BTC due to the premium the MSTR stock price. It's important to understand both sides of this trade idea to firmly put yourself into a mindset to accurately understand how this trade functions.

## Core Business

Microstrategy is, at its core, a software / IT services company that remains extremely vital to its bitcoin treasury ambitions. What does the core business give Saylor in his quest to be able to build this bitcoin treasury? A balance sheet. The balance sheet allows him to do corporate bond offerings that other entities could not do if they simply just wanted to build a BTC treasury through convertible debt raises. The core business also provides MSTR a cash flow that allows MSTR to meet any tax or debt servicing obligations that may arise. However, when compared to the size of their treasury, their current core business is miniscule in size thereby making MSTR a de facto bitcoin treasury that has the ability to issue corporate debt.

## MSTR "Buttons & Levers"

MSTR has several levers to use or raise funds to buy more BTC for their treasury which include, but are not limited to -
- Traditional debt - taking a traditional loan from a lender, but using it to buy BTC or to "roll debt" at the current interest rate. The issue with the traditional debt route is the collateral in the past used by MSTR was their BTC which then were encumbered. This is obviously not ideal and they have since moved away from this strategy as conditions have allowed.
- Convertible debt - long-term bonds with the option to convert into shares at certain prices, MSTR's have been issued at a low interest rate redeemable at ~30-40% above the current MSTR price, but governed by conversion rules and time tables.
- Equity / ATM ("At-the-Market") equity offerings - selling shares of the equity into the market to raise capital

The ATM equity offerings are particularly interesting here the MSTR ATM deviates from the traditional ATM narrative. For most traditional companies, when you do ATMs, you're usually raising capital for either CapEx (capital expenditures) or OpEx (operational expenditures) with the purpose of keeping the company moving forward, but while diluting current shareholders. With the MSTR shareholders, these ATM raises are being used to add to the BTC treasury so while the # of outstanding shares goes up and dilutes stock holders in a "their holdings"/"total shares" sense, MSTR attempts to not dilute these holders in the "BTC per outstanding share" sense. The key phrase here that you will hear is that the MSTR ATM offerings are "accretive" to shareholders due to this BTC/share ratio (or as MSTR calls it, their BTC Yield) going up.

### Why So Many Funding Strategies?

The reason for so many funding strategies is that one strategy isn't optimal for all market conditions; therefore, MSTR has decided to deploy these different capital raising mechanisms as optimally as possible based on market conditions. For instance, when the MSTR market cap is trading at a very high premium to its NAV (Net Asset Value), ATM offerings might make more sense than a debt offering because at a very high NAV premium, the ATM offering should be highly accretive meaning the amount of BTC that can be bought should increase the BTC per share ratio plus there should be sufficent interest in the market to absorb this Common A share dilution.

Simply, as the mNAV increases, the attractiveness to ATM increases because the BTC / share accretion percentage increases if an ATM is executed and it's highly likely the market conditions are amicable to perform an ATM.

However, ATMs might not always make sense with the bitcoin market, MSTR share, market appetite for immediate dilution, price or NAV premium conditions. Therefore, instead of just waiting out these bearish periods or periods of little NAV premium (at a discount you might be forced to take on traditional debt), MSTR has the option of offering convertible bonds. Convertible bonds are an extremely attractive lever for MSTR to pull since convertible bonds are accessible to a part of the market or liquidity pool that doesn't have the ability to access other bitcoin related instruments like BTC spot or BTC ETFs or futures/options. These convertible bonds are highly attractive to the fixed income market because they are packaged and structured with more volatility than most anything else available to these traders and so there's serious appetite in this marketplace for these MSTR convertible bonds. Since the convertible bonds have been priced with a 130-140% conversion and are long dated (the most recent one was set at 55%), convertible bonds are a more attractive option than ATMs in non-bullish environments to continue to buy BTC at non-peak prices, but can obviously still be issued in extremely bullish environments. While some of these bond offerings may not be as accretive when issued in poor market conditions, they allow the purchasing timing of bitcoin to be done at lower mNAVs - although historically MSTR has been way less aggressive acquiring bitcoin at lows than at highs. However, there may be a scenario where issuing convertible bonds at a high premium, but near the very top of the end of a long term bull cycle might / will carry more risk than bonds issued in other conditions; however, MSTR would argue the long dated nature of the bonds plus bitcoin's historical price gains limit the risk exposure for these, currently, overcollateralized bonds.

## Convertible Debt Concepts & Conversion Rules

Saylor's idea here and the mechanics are the following -
- Issue convertible debt
- The bond will have a "conversion rate" that will state how many class A shares someone will get per some x $ amount. Many of the MSTR convertible bonds will have a premium built in which you can determine by taking the Per $ Amount / # of class A shares received which will give you a MSTR share price which you then compare to the current market rate to figure out the premium.
- The more premium that is built into the bond, the less future dilution will occur, but the risk that the bond won't convert increases.
- At the time of this issue, the conversion is accounted for immeditaely in the "Assumed Diluted Shares" or "implied outstanding shares"
- By doing it this way, the BTC Yield KPI that MSTR uses already accounts for debt conversion and dilution
- If conversions happen, whether due to maturity and or the execution of the several conversion rules, on these redemptions where the bond holders redeem to get their capital returned, Saylor intends to just issue more convertible debt to buy more BTC which allow him to continue to acquire more BTC.
- MSTR structures and staggers these bonds so that their maturity dates aren't all stacked on top of each other

What about from the convertible bond buyer's perspective?



### What are the Rules for Conversion

There are several rules that dictate conversion of these convertible bonds (note, these are the rules that are currently being used, they may use different rules in the future) - 
- The 130% Rule - 

## "Where Does The Demand Come From MFer" - Chasing Goose

The leverage and the volatility. 

Almost every MSTR analyst that leans to the bull thesis will tell you it comes from the volatility built into the instruments. However, there is also this very basic, implied belief that bitcoin, on long time horizons, will continue to go up vs the USD due to many of the same BTC bull thesis reasons (fixed supply, M1/M2 expansion, continued debasement of the currency, increased social welfare, possible strategy to inflate away the US' debt obligations, etc etc).

## The MSTR BTC Yield KPI

This is your bull thesis in its entirety.

While not a new concept, the Bitcoin Yield KPI first started appearing in earnest <a href="https://assets.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltb564490bc5201f31/blt47c4fe8efa72ccd4/66abec040ccb2f50c2802684/form-8-k_08-01-2024.pdf">in the 2024 August 8-K form</a>. In this 8-K, MSTR outlined in text format the idea of how while there is actual share dilution vs total shares that the share dilution was actually accretive to shareholders using the BTC Yield KPI metric. This metric is defined as - 

BTC Yield = Total Bitcoin Holdings / Assumed Diluted Shares Outstanding

First, how are "Assumed Diluted Shares Outstanding" defined? Accoring to the 13 Sept 2024 8-K form, this is defined as "<i>Assumed Diluted Shares Outstanding refers to the aggregate of our actual shares of common stock outstanding as of the end of each period plus all additional shares that would result from the assumed conversion of all outstanding convertible notes, exercise of all outstanding stock option awards, and settlement of all outstanding restricted stock units and performance stock units</i>".

## mNAV & "Should There Be A Premium?"

In Progress - Geographic regulatory arbitrage, tax differences vs buying spot BTC
Ex: Metaplanet - Marginal tax on crypto gains is treated like misc income in Japan so can be taxed up to 55%, but listed securities are 20%

## Ownership Dilution

MSTR's strategy is to be accretive in terms of BTC held in the treasury per Assumed Outstanding shares of MSTR so MSTR will argue that the issuing of more Class A stock is not dilutive at all - however, that is not the only dilution that we care about. On 30 Oct 2024 Saylor answered a question regarding the $21 billion ATM that was announced and how this will effect his majority ownership stake and how he sees his stake being diluted.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2eca26fa-2752-454e-bd74-edd78f2eff3a

Saylor's argument basically boils down to "it's fine" and "no big deal" and that the other holders of the A shares are always in contact with people at MSTR and they understand the vision and they understand what MSTR is trying to accomplish. He also mentions that een when he dips into the 40% range that he may be able to find "2 or 3 holders to vote with him". This talking point has morphed over time where he now presents this as "the decentralization of the stock" and presents MSTR as a more "mature" company now that they have reached this stage of their bitcoin strategy.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f81fe79-7a11-4166-be3a-80ff38852804

While this may be very true, there is some non-zero risk here. On the positive side, there are some "MAD" principles here (Mutually Assured Destruction) where shareholders would destroy their own value is they ever voted to dissolve or start selling any bitcoin from the treasury - the voting to sell some part of the treasury immediately destroys the illusion of a "closed fund" which MSTR currently acts like.

### Key Man Risk

In addition to dilution concerns, MSTR has very clear "Key Man" concerns - in other words, what is the Continuity Plan if something was to happen to Saylor - the man controlling the MSTR votes with his Class B shares and being (mostly) the last word on MSTR never selling a single satoshi. Saylor speaks about this issue in-depth here - 

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46d2a8ad-6f2b-49be-a62b-0bfc95b5d1ca

Saylor states that he has no heirs and therefore, upon his journey to the eternal darkness, his bitcoin and his shares will go to a non-profit, public charity that's mission is the advancement of bitcoin.

## "Miscellaneous Trivia"

Other factors to consider in the MSTR analysis - 
- Switch to fair value accounting (some refer to this as FASB) still pending. CFO Andrew Kang seemed to indicate on the 30 Oct 2024 Investors Call that they will be adopting FASB Q1 2025, but a bit unclear at the time of this writing.
- Inclusion into Nasdaq indices - the next decision date (at the time of this writing) is 13 Dec 2024 for a decision on inclusion and, if included 20 Dec 2024 to rebalanace. (Update: Included into QQQ 13 December 2024)

### Facts

- "MSTR was kind enough to confirm that the 130% rule is based on a rolling 30 day period and not a fixed 30 day period in the quarter", Source: https://x.com/BenWerkman/status/1847368302663716965
- The convertible bonds outperforming spot bitcoin in the first 3 quarters of 2024 which is not a thing that happens.

## So What Are the Actual (Theoretical) Risks?

Now that we understand the concepts behind the trade, what exactly are the risks? If you believe many of the MSTR bulls, nothing can stop Saylor and this borders on an "infinite money glitch" where Saylor "Vampire Attacks" the USD or a perpetual motion machine. While I do agree on the surface that there are some basic conditions that should allow this strategy to work pretty well, I do find it hard to believe that there are no risk factors and that this is an unstoppable perpetual motion machine. So, what are some of those risks?
- Core software business threatened by AI limiting cash flow needed for debt servicing
- Implied agreement by MSTR/Saylor not to sell a single satoshi & act as a "closed fund"
- Bitcoin financial services / bank / lending business never materializes
- Continued aggressive dilution of the Common A shares opening up potential for a hostile takeover attempt
- Minneapolis Fed paper outlining debt issuing problems when bitcoin exists in the fixed income market
- Normal bitcoin / crypto custodial risks
- Protracted bitcoin bear market and / or adherence to the historical ABCD 4 year cycle
- Continued muting of bitcoin volatility
- Normal bitcoin regulatory related concerns
- Is there a limit to the size of their holdings before the market no longer MTMs (mark-to-market) their BTC treasury?

All businesses have risks so this isn't any slight towards MSTR the company, but to properly assess the risk associated with the MSTR BTC Treasury strategy one must understand the risks involved. The easiest one is that the core business is threatened by AI and that AI eats into the cash flow of MSTR. A substantial decrease of their cash flow from their core business may make the 2nd risk more relevant - acting as a closed fund. The counterargument to the core business not having a substantial positive cash flow is that many believer that shareholders will raise the capital needed to meet the debt servicing obligations (which are currently in the low 10s of millions).

Saylor has stated many times that his promise to investors, as well as short sellers, is that he will not sell any bitcoin through MSTR from their BTC treasury. This statement allows MSTR to act like a "closed fund" much like GBTC did before redemptions were allowed through the spot ETF conversion. While there is tremendous upside with this promise to investors that they won't sell any bitcoin (MSTR trivia - they actually did sell BTC once on 22 Dec 2022 through Macrostrategy), this "promise" boxes MSTR into a strategy where they can never really sell a satoshi without breaking this covenant. Now, MSTR bulls will counter that this will be an extremely easy bar to clear as there is no desire among shareholders to see or force MSTR to sell a single satoshi.

With the core Microstrategy business definitely on a slow downtrend (this cannot be disputed) and with the very real business damaging growth of AI around the corner, Microstrategy may face certain cash flow issues if no bitcoin lending / bank / financial services business ever develops. Saylor himself has been quoted that right now his company is making a very high RFR on his cash with just the treasury operation so there's no need for a "second great idea". If no bitcoin lending or financial services business is ever developed, MSTR's entire exposure will be to the bitcoin price and their ability to ATM, complete convertible bond issues or raise money with some other method.

While Bitcoin Yield is the KPI that MSTR cares about when diluting the class A shares, there <strong>is</strong> dilution still happening on the class A shares. Saylor is already under 50% voting power even with all of his 10x Class B shares. This is covered in the section above entitled "Ownership Dilution". While Saylor has mentioned that he will still own enough class A shares that he could get a few major holders to vote with him to keep control, there is still some non-zero risk here, especially if the regulatory environment deteriorates 4 years from today (2024), where major holders of MSTR will not vote rationally and shareholders may vote for a proposal that breaks some of the assumptions mentioned above. This is likely not to be a short term problem and likely to not be a problem under the current US administration, as the dilution not only continues but accelerates, this could become an attack vector especially if there is a regime change in 2028.

Probably one of the more underdiscussed potential risks of MSTR was a very underpromoted paper that was published by the Minneapolis Federal Reserve entitled <a href="https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/working-papers/unique-implementation-of-permanent-primary-deficits">"Unique Implementation of Permanent Primary Deficits?"</a>. While one may see that title and ask "What does any of that have to do with bitcoin?", all one has to do is read the beginning of the paper to realize what the paper is really about -

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05e948bf-e8ad-4f77-9719-ab8328bfe959)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f03801f4-77e8-488b-9d9d-c05fb7ad72eb)

Now, it's important to note that this paper was released and written before the most recent US presidential election, but even with a more pro-crypto administration, push come to shove if the Federal Government needs to slow bitcoin down in order to issue debt through taxation, then that's exactly what they will do. Remember, at the end of the day, the entire MSTR strategy is a speculative attack against the USD so there is some extreme level of penetration where the government may be forced to, at the very least, slow bitcoin down.

MSTR's full custodial solution is not full known and therefore there are potentially more risks here than the market may realize. The following are Saylor's most recent comments on MSTR's custody solution and rationale for not providing Proof of Reserves -

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa6d7757-0b2e-4cfe-920a-a936df07a02a

Saylor's answer simultaneously makes a lot of sense and no sense. Yes, knowing the actual custodians could open up employees at that organization to phishing and hacking attacks where those attacks are specifically targeted using Microstrategy specific information and requests. However, it's mostly idiotic to think that onchain forensics researchers don't know a very high percentage of the wallets and coins associated to MSTR. The sheer scale of MSTR's buying operation in such short timeframes makes fingerprinting their buying settlement possible (not easy, but possible). While I am unaware of a single researcher who knows all of the MSTR wallet addresses, I know several (including myself) that knows a very high % of them.

## Execution of Strategy

In addition to the theoretical pros and cons of the investment thesis and MSTR strategy, there's also the issue of how these strategies are executed and if they have been executed optimally. This section will mainly focus on my opinion of mistakes versus the good execution since it's rare that the good execution doesn't get reflected in the MSTR stock price. Again, these are my opinions and not facts like most of the information presented above. Additionally, my opinion holds that most of the missteps occurred in the last 2 months of 2024 where as, prior to that timeframe, MSTR executed about as flawlessly as one could have expected.

Quickly, some of the excellent execution from MSTR would include - 
- Moving away from any traditional debt, paying that traditional debt off and moving to raising debt through convertible bonds.
- Performing ATMs when mNAV is extremely high - performing ATMs when mNAV is super high is the correct strategy; however, how hard you hit the ATM in these conditions is another story
- Staggering the maturity of the convertible debt so that multiple bonds do not mature at the same time possibly causing an outsized bond repayment situation if the bonds don't convert.

Some of the execution missteps, in my opinion, are the following -
- Misjudged the size of his offerings at the 30 Oct 2024 earnings call - on the 30 Oct 2024 earnings call, MSTR proposed a $42 billion over 3 years offering of new Common A shares to buy more bitcoin broken down by $21 billion in ATMs and $20 billion in convertible bonds. However, in the 7 weeks since that call, MSTR utilized ~$18 billion before the calendar even hit 2025. While MSTR was right to take advantage of the very high mNAV, MSTR clearly underestimated the market demand and their intentions which makes their massive acceleration of this offering look a little recless optically.
 
- ATMing to the Destruction of Momentum - While absolutely very good policy to ATM when MSTR is trading at a very high mNAV or MAV Multiple, MSTR also relies on a high mNAV for their offerings to be more accretive. MSTR, the high mNAV, etc can all be summarized as a "momentum play". While there's no guarantee that a high mNAV will persist even without a very aggressive ATM, this strategy definitely lowers/lowered the probability that "higher for longer" would continue. Coupling this aggressive acceleration of ATMing with the prior point of such a wild deviation from their recently proposed offering plan, the market has not looked at the MSTR equity price favorably and the mNAV continues to fall killing all momentum.

- Nov 2024 Convertible Structure in midst of $15 billion of ATM - When issuing a convertible bond, there's a few elements structured into a convertible bond - the size, the interest rate, the maturity date and the premium built into the bond. For the 19 Nov 2024 convertible bond specifically, the basic terms of this bond were - <em>The conversion rate for the notes is initially 1.4872 shares of MicroStrategy’s class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $672.40 per share. This represents a premium of approximately 55% over the U.S. composite volume weighted average price of MicroStrategy’s class A common stock from 1:30 p.m. through 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on November 19, 2024, which was $433.7997</em>. Here's the suboptimal execution - this bond was issued with an mNAV between 3.19 and 3.4, an extremely high mNAV that was likely to come down on its own. Then, MSTR proceeded to be highly aggressive with their ATM offerings accelerating to a pace that would almost certainly bring down the mNAV. Third, they completed the offering at a very robust resistance ($100k). When you combine all of these factors together, you get an increased probability that these aren't ideal conditions to issue a convertible bond at and the probability rises that the bond won't convert by maturity. Unfortunately, the theoretical played out with an immediate crushing of the mNAV from 3.4 to below 2 and with the stock price (at the time of this writing) falling to a price that now requires MSTR to double in price for the bond to convert. While tha maturity for this bond is ~5 years away and even if the bond doesn't convert doesn't mean they can't roll the debt, my very strong opinion is that MSTR should be performing optimal execution to avoid non-conversion bond repayments as much as possible.

- Accelerating the BTC KPI - While this seems like a good thing, more yield or more BTC/share seems like a good thing, with MSTR's aggressive buying at the end of 2024, when they go to report their 2025 yeild, without even more acceleration, the 2025 yield is going to look poor in comparison and will make MSTR momentum appear to be drastically slowing down. This is yet another example of how MSTR and mNAV expansion and contraction all being a huge momentum trade. With falling yields, mNAV should contract until the cycle reverses and as the mNAV contracts, the accretion per offering decreases.

In addition to the execution of their strategy, there's also just the basic execution of how they are purchasing in the market. Here's Saylor's own words on how they are purchasing BTC -

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b783ffd-38d0-4a66-a508-0887da46234d

Quite frankly, while I believe that they are likely performing some basic WAP strategy, I do not believe him that he has no influence on price and many sophisticated traders know exactly the things to look for to know when MSTR is being overly aggressive in the market. It's virtually impossible, with the size he was transacting with in Nov/Dec 2024, to not influence the price and he absolutely was. Conversely, when the buying slowed down at the end of Dec 2024, the disappearance of the MSTR bid was also noticeable to sophisticated traders as well as the top tier chain forensics researchers.

## 2x MSTR ETFs & Reflexivity

On top of the single equity MSTR, there are numerous 2x MSTR ETFs with the two long ETFs being MSTU and MSTX. While nothing is inherently wrong with single stock 2x ETFs, at a certain scale real issues can develop with their ability to disrupt the overall market. Turns out at the time of this writing, these two MSTR 2x long ETFs have an AUM of about ~$5 billion which is an extremely significant size / scale.

The general mechanic of how these 2x single equity ETFs work is that the ETF must constantly rebalance their holdings to match not only their AUM (assets under management), but also the price of the underlying equity. The way this rebalancing works is that for every $1 of total net asset value, the ETF must hold $2 worth of long exposure.

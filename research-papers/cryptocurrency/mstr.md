# Mircrostrategy (MSTR) Investment Analysis

The following is an attempt to spell out as many angles of the MSTR trade as I possibly can. Warning - I do not feel comfortable writing on this topic because I feel like I maybe understand 90% of it and the last 10% is very likely to hold a lot of value. However, this has been a very requested topic; therefore, I am attempting to create a reference document.<br />

## Core Business

Microstrategy is, at its core, a software / IT services company that remains extremely vital to its bitcoin treasury ambitions. What does the core business give Saylor in his quest to be able to build this bitcoin treasury? A balance sheet.

## MSTR "Buttons & Levers"

MSTR has several levers to use or raise funds to buy more BTC for their treasury which include, but are not limited to -
- Traditional debt - taking a traditional loan from a lender, but using it to buy BTC
- Convertible debt - long-term bonds with the option to convert into shares at certain prices, MSTR's have been issued at a low interest rate redeemable at ~30-40% above the current MSTR price, but governed by conversion rules and time tables.
- Equity / ATM ("At-the-Market") equity offerings - selling shares of the equity into the market to raise capital

The ATM equity offerings are particularly interesting here because it feeds one specific narrative. For most traditional companies, when you do ATMs, you're usually raising capital for either CapEx (capital expenditures) or OpEx (operational expenditures) with the purpose of keeping the company moving forward, but while diluting current shareholders. With the MSTR shareholders, these ATM raises are being used to add to the BTC treasury so while the # of outstanding shares goes up and dilutes stock holders in a "their holdings"/"total shares" sense, MSTR attempts to not dilute these holders in the "BTC per outstanding share" sense. The key phrase here that you will hear is that the MSTR ATM offerings are "accretive" to shareholders due to this BTC/share ratio going up.

### Why So Many Funding Strategies?

The reason for so many funding strategies is that one strategy isn't optimal for all market conditions; therefore, MSTR has decided to deploy these different capital raising mechanisms as optimally as possible based on market conditions. For instance, when the MSTR market cap is trading at a very high premium to its NAV (Net Asset Value), ATM offerings might make more sense than a debt offering because at a very high NAV premium, the ATM offering should be accretive meaning the amount of BTC that can be bought should increase the BTC per share ratio.

However, ATMs might not always make sense with the bitcoin market, MSTR share price or NAV premium conditions. Therefore, instead of just waiting out these bearish periods or periods of little NAV premium (at a discount you might be forced to take on traditional debt), MSTR has the option of offering convertible bonds. Convertible bonds are an extremely attractive lever for MSTR to pull since convertible bonds are accessible to a part of the market or liquidity pool that doesn't have the ability to access other bitcoin related instruments like BTC spot or BTC ETFs or futures/options. These convertible bonds are highly attractive to the fixed income market because they are packaged and structured with more volatility than most anything else available to these traders and so there's some appetite in this marketplace for these MSTR convertible bonds. 

## Convertible Debt Concepts & Conversion Rules

Saylor's idea here and the mechanics are the following -
- Issue convertible debt
- At the time of this issue, the conversion is accounted for immeditaely in the "Assumed Diluted Shares" or "implied outstanding shares"
- By doing it this way, the BTC/ratio already accounts for debt conversion and dilution
- If conversions happen, whether due to maturity and or the execution of the several conversion rules, on these redemptions where the bond holders redeem to get their capital returned, Saylor intends to just issue more convertible debt to buy more BTC which allow him to continue to acquire more BTC.

### What are the Rules for Conversion

There are several rules that dictate conversion of these convertible bonds (note, these are the rules that are currently being used, they may use different rules in the future) - 
- The 130% Rule -

The volatility. 

Almost every MSTR analyst that leans to the bull thesis will tell you it comes from the volatility built into the instruments. However, there is also this very basic, implied belief that bitcoin, on long time horizons, will continue to go up vs the USD due to many of the same BTC bull thesis reasons (fixed supply, M1/M2 expansion, continued debasement of the currency, increased social welfare, possible strategy to inflate away the US' debt obligations, etc etc).

## The MSTR BTC Yield KPI

This is your bull thesis in its entirety.

While not a new concept, the Bitcoin Yield KPI first started appearing in earnest <a href="https://assets.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltb564490bc5201f31/blt47c4fe8efa72ccd4/66abec040ccb2f50c2802684/form-8-k_08-01-2024.pdf">in the August 8-K form</a>. In this 8-K, MSTR outlined in text format the idea of how while there is actual share dilution vs total shares that the share dilution was actually accretive to shareholders using the BTC Yield KPI metric. This metric is defined as - 

BTC Yield = Total Bitcoin Holdings / Assumed Diluted Shares Outstanding

First, how are "Assumed Diluted Shares Outstanding" defined? Accoring to the 13 Sept 2024 8-K form, this is defined as "<i>Assumed Diluted Shares Outstanding refers to the aggregate of our actual shares of common stock outstanding as of the end of each period plus all additional shares that would result from the assumed conversion of all outstanding convertible notes, exercise of all outstanding stock option awards, and settlement of all outstanding restricted stock units and performance stock units</i>".

## Ownership Dilution

MSTR's strategy is to be accretive in terms of BTC held in the treasury per Assumed Outstanding shares of MSTR so MSTR will argue that the issuing of more Class A stock is not dilutive at all - however, that is not the only dilution that we care about. On 30 Oct 2024 Saylor answered a question regarding the $21 billion ATM that was announced and how this will effect his majority ownership stake and how he sees his stake being diluted.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2eca26fa-2752-454e-bd74-edd78f2eff3a

Saylor's argument basically boils down to "it's fine" and "no big deal" and that the other holders of the A shares are always in contact with people at MSTR and they understand the vision and they understand what MSTR is trying to accomplish. He also mentions that een when he dips into the 40% range that he may be able to find "2 or 3 holders to vote with him". While this may be very true, there is some non-zero risk here. On the positive side, there are some "MAD" principles here (Mutually Assured Destruction) where shareholders would destroy their own value is they ever voted to dissolve or start selling any bitcoin from the treasury - the voting to sell some part of the treasury immediately destroys the illusion of a "closed fund" which MSTR currently acts like.

### Key Man Risk

In addition to dilution concerns, MSTR has very clear "Key Man" concerns - in other words, what is the Continuity Plan if something was to happen to Saylor - the man controlling the MSTR votes with his Class B shares and being (mostly) the last word on MSTR never selling a single satoshi. Saylor speaks about this issue in-depth here - 

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46d2a8ad-6f2b-49be-a62b-0bfc95b5d1ca

Saylor states that he has no heirs and therefore, upon his journey to the eternal darkness, his bitcoin and his shares will go to a non-profit, public charity that's mission is the advancement of bitcoin.

## "Miscellaneous Trivia"

Other factors to consider in the MSTR analysis - 
- Switch to fair value accounting (some refer to this as FASB) still pending. CFO Andrew kang seemed to indicate on the 30 Oct 2024 Investors Call that they will be adopting FASB Q1 2025, but a bit unclear at the time of this writing.
- Inclusion into Nasdaq indices

### Facts

"MSTR was kind enough to confirm that the 130% rule is based on a rolling 30 day period and not a fixed 30 day period in the quarter" - Source: https://x.com/BenWerkman/status/1847368302663716965

## Interpreting the Data

Once you understand the strategy behind what MSTR's plan is, it's time to start interpreting all the data and you must understand how to navigate all of the relevant data points. One of the first visits an analyst should take is to the MSTR Form 8-Ks. Here you will find information regarding their "Indebtedness and Interest Expense" and "Bitcoin Holdings".

## So What Are the Actual Risks?

Now that we understand the concepts behind the trade, what exactly are the risks? If you believe many of the MSTR bulls, nothing can stop Saylor and this borders on an "infinite money glitch" where Saylor "Vampire Attacks" the USD or a perpetual motion machine. While I do agree on the surface that there are some basic conditions that should allow this strategy to work pretty well, I do find it hard to believe that there are no risk factors and that this is an unstoppable perpetual motion machine. So, what are some of those risks?
- Core software business threatened by AI limiting cash flow needed for debt servicing
- Implied agreement by MSTR/Saylor not to sell a single satoshi & act as a "closed fund"
- Bitcoin financial services / bank / lending business never materializes
- Continued aggressive dilution of the Common A shares opening up potential for a hostile takeover attempt
- Minneapolis Fed paper outlining debt issuing problems when bitcoin exists in the fixed income market
- Protracted bitcoin bear market and / or adherence to the historical ABCD 4 year cycle
- Normal bitcoin regulatory related concerns

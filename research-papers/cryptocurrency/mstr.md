# Mircrostrategy (MSTR) Investment Analysis

The following is an attempt to spell out as many angles of the MSTR trade as I possibly can. Warning - I do not feel comfortable writing on this topic because I feel like I maybe understand 90% of it and the last 10% is very likely to hold a lot of value. However, this has been a very requested topic; therefore, I am attempting to create a reference document.<br />

## Core Business

Microstrategy is, at its core, a software / IT services company that remains extremely vital to its bitcoin treasury ambitions. What does the core business give Saylor in his quest to be able to build this bitcoin treasury? A balance sheet.

## MSTR "Levers"

MSTR has several levers to use or raise funds to buy more BTC for their treasury which include, but are not limited to -
- Traditional debt - taking a traditional loan from a lender, but using it to buy BTC
- Convertible debt
- Equity / ATM ("At-the-Market") equity offerings - selling shares of the equity into the market to raise capital

The ATM equity offerings are particularly interesting here because it feeds one specific narrative. For most traditional companies, when you do ATMs, you're usually raising capital for either CapEx (capital expenditures) or OpEx (operational expenditures) with the purpose of keeping the company moving forward, but while diluting current shareholders. With the MSTR shareholders, these ATM raises are being used to add to the BTC treasury so while the # of outstanding shares goes up and dilutes stock holders in a "their holdings"/"total shares" sense, MSTR attempts to not dilute these holders in the "BTC per outstanding share" sense. The key phrase here that you will hear is that the MSTR ATM offerings are "accretive" to shareholders due to this BTC/share ratio going up.

### Why So Many Funding Strategies?

The reason for so many funding strategies is that one strategy isn't optimal for all market conditions; therefore, MSTR has decided to deploy these different capital raising mechanisms as optimally as possible based on market conditions. For instance, when the MSTR market cap is trading at a very high premium to its NAV (Net Asset Value), ATM offerings might make more sense than a debt offering because at a very high NAV premium, the ATM offering should be accretive meaning the amount of BTC that can be bought should increase the BTC per share ratio.

## Convertible Debt Conversion

Saylor's idea here and the mechanics are the following -
- Issue convertible debt
- At the time of this issue, the conversion is accounted for immeditaely in the "implied outstanding shares"
- By doing it this way, the BTC/ratio already accounts for debt conversion and dilution
- If conversions happen, Saylor intends to just issue more convertible debt to buy more BTC which allow him to continue to acquire more BTC

## "Miscellaneous Trivia"

Other factors to consider in the MSTR analysis - 
- Switch to FASB accounting still pending
- Inclusion into Nasdaq indices

### Facts

"MSTR was kind enough to confirm that the 130% rule is based on a rolling 30 day period and not a fixed 30 day period in the quarter" - Source: https://x.com/BenWerkman/status/1847368302663716965

## Interpreting the Data

Once you understand the strategy behind what MSTR's plan is, it's time to start interpreting all the data and you must understand how to navigate all of the relevant data points. One of the first visits an analyst should take is to the MSTR Form 8-Ks. Here you will find information regarding their "Indebtedness and Interest Expense" and "Bitcoin Holdings".

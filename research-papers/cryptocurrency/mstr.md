# Mircrostrategy (MSTR) Investment Analysis

The following is an attempt to spell out as many angles of the MSTR trade as I possibly can. Warning - I do not feel comfortable writing on this topic because I feel like I maybe understand 90% of it and the last 10% is very likely to hold a lot of value. However, this has been a very requested topic; therefore, I am attempting to create a reference document.<br />

## Core Business

Microstrategy is, at its core, a software / IT services company that remains extremely vital to its bitcoin treasury ambitions. What does the core business give Saylor in his quest to be able to build this bitcoin treasury? A balance sheet.

## MSTR "Buttons & Levers"

MSTR has several levers to use or raise funds to buy more BTC for their treasury which include, but are not limited to -
- Traditional debt - taking a traditional loan from a lender, but using it to buy BTC
- Convertible debt - bond with the option to convert into shares at certain prices
- Equity / ATM ("At-the-Market") equity offerings - selling shares of the equity into the market to raise capital

The ATM equity offerings are particularly interesting here because it feeds one specific narrative. For most traditional companies, when you do ATMs, you're usually raising capital for either CapEx (capital expenditures) or OpEx (operational expenditures) with the purpose of keeping the company moving forward, but while diluting current shareholders. With the MSTR shareholders, these ATM raises are being used to add to the BTC treasury so while the # of outstanding shares goes up and dilutes stock holders in a "their holdings"/"total shares" sense, MSTR attempts to not dilute these holders in the "BTC per outstanding share" sense. The key phrase here that you will hear is that the MSTR ATM offerings are "accretive" to shareholders due to this BTC/share ratio going up.

### Why So Many Funding Strategies?

The reason for so many funding strategies is that one strategy isn't optimal for all market conditions; therefore, MSTR has decided to deploy these different capital raising mechanisms as optimally as possible based on market conditions. For instance, when the MSTR market cap is trading at a very high premium to its NAV (Net Asset Value), ATM offerings might make more sense than a debt offering because at a very high NAV premium, the ATM offering should be accretive meaning the amount of BTC that can be bought should increase the BTC per share ratio.

However, ATMs might not always make sense with the bitcoin market conditions. Therefore, instead of just waiting out these bearish periods or periods of little NAV premium (at a discount you might be forced to take on traditional debt), MSTR has the option of offering convertible bonds. Convertible bonds are an extremely attractive lever for MSTR to pull since convertible bonds are accessible to a part of the market or liquidity pool that doesn't have the ability to access other bitcoin related instruments like BTC spot or BTC ETFs or futures/options. These convertible bonds are highly attractive to the fixed income market because they are packaged and structured with more volatility than most anything else available to these traders and so there's some appetite in this marketplace for these MSTR convertible bonds. 

## Convertible Debt Conversion

Saylor's idea here and the mechanics are the following -
- Issue convertible debt
- At the time of this issue, the conversion is accounted for immeditaely in the "Assumed Diluted Shares" or "implied outstanding shares"
- By doing it this way, the BTC/ratio already accounts for debt conversion and dilution
- If conversions happen, Saylor intends to just issue more convertible debt to buy more BTC which allow him to continue to acquire more BTC

## The MSTR BTC Yield KPI

This is your bull thesis in its entirety.

While not a new concept, the Bitcoin Yield KPI first started appearing in earnest <a href="https://assets.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltb564490bc5201f31/blt47c4fe8efa72ccd4/66abec040ccb2f50c2802684/form-8-k_08-01-2024.pdf">in the August 8-K form</a>. In this 8-K, MSTR outlined in text format the idea of how while there is actual share dilution vs total shares that the share dilution was actually accretive to shareholders using the BTC Yield KPI metric. This metric is defined as - 

BTC Yield = Total Bitcoin Holdings / Assumed Diluted Shares Outstanding

First, how are "Assumed Diluted Shares Outstanding" defined? Accoring to the 13 Sept 2024 8-K form, this is defined as "<i>Assumed Diluted Shares Outstanding refers to the aggregate of our actual shares of common stock outstanding as of the end of each period plus all additional shares that would result from the assumed conversion of all outstanding convertible notes, exercise of all outstanding stock option awards, and settlement of all outstanding restricted stock units and performance stock units</i>".

## Ownership Dilution

MSTR's strategy is to be accretive in terms of BTC held in the treasury per Assumed Outstanding shares of MSTR so MSTR will argue that the issuing of more Class A stock is not dilutive at all - however, that is not the only dilution that we care about. On 30 Oct 2024 Saylor answered a question regarding the $21 billion ATM that was announced and how this will effect his majority ownership stake and how he sees his stake being diluted.

Saylor's argument basically boils down to "it's fine" and "no big deal" and that the other holders of the A shares are always in contact with people at MSTR and they understand the vision and they understand what MSTR is trying to accomplish. He also mentions that een when he dips into the 40% range that he may be able to find "2 or 3 holders to vote with him". While this may be very true, there is some non-zero risk here. On the positive side, there are some "MAD" principles here (Mutually Assured Destruction) where shareholders would destroy their own value is they ever voted to dissolve or start selling any bitcoin from the treasury - the voting to sell some part of the treasury immediately destroys the illusion of a "closed fund" which MSTR currently acts like.

## "Miscellaneous Trivia"

Other factors to consider in the MSTR analysis - 
- Switch to FASB accounting still pending and associated tax bill with this switch
- Inclusion into Nasdaq indices

### Facts

"MSTR was kind enough to confirm that the 130% rule is based on a rolling 30 day period and not a fixed 30 day period in the quarter" - Source: https://x.com/BenWerkman/status/1847368302663716965

## Interpreting the Data

Once you understand the strategy behind what MSTR's plan is, it's time to start interpreting all the data and you must understand how to navigate all of the relevant data points. One of the first visits an analyst should take is to the MSTR Form 8-Ks. Here you will find information regarding their "Indebtedness and Interest Expense" and "Bitcoin Holdings".

# Mircrostrategy (MSTR) Investment Analysis

The following is an attempt to spell out as many angles of the MSTR trade as I possibly can. Warning - I do not feel comfortable writing on this topic because I feel like I maybe understand 90% of it and the last 10% is very likely to hold a lot of value. However, this has been a very requested topic; therefore, I am attempting to create a reference document.<br /><br />

### Facts

"MSTR was kind enough to confirm that the 130% rule is based on a rolling 30 day period and not a fixed 30 day period in the quarter" - Source: https://x.com/BenWerkman/status/1847368302663716965

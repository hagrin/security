# Satoshi Candidates

Rumored potential Satoshis. This list isn't meant to be all encompassing, but maintained because I get this question a lot. The candidates are listed in some alphabetical order. While I understand the fascination with trying to figure out who Satoshi is, understand that by publishing anything saying "X person is Satoshi" puts that person and their family in physical danger. You should use extreme caution before publishing anything that attempts to definitively identify Satoshi's identity.<br />

## Adam Back
- Pro:
- Cons: At the Craig Wright trial, Adam submitted his correspondence with Satoshi into evidence - a total of 5 emails, Satoshi engaging Adam regarding a citation of his Hashcash paper and then some discussion about alternate whitepapers and the bitcoin whitepaper.

## Craig Wright

Get absolutely rekt you freaking loser.

## Dustin D. Trammell

- Cons: https://blog.dustintrammell.com/i-am-not-satoshi/ - written by himself where you can download his email correspondence with Satoshi. Dustin also debunks a flawed research paper written out of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel.

## Hal Finney
- Pros:
- Cons: https://blog.lopp.net/hal-finney-was-not-satoshi-nakamoto/

## Jack Dorsey
- Pros: https://x.com/financeguy74/status/1890850549035110558
- Cons: Pete Rizzo and Jameson Lopp did a podcast where Lopp took it upon himself to try and "disprove the negative". Satoshi, who seems very strongly linked to the Pacific Time Zone, is almost definitely not bicoastal and Jack at the time was bicoastal as he was running 2 large companies at the time. A temporal analysis of Jack's tweets show this phenomenon where there's no adherence to the Pacific Time Zone. Jack also has very public meetings with government officials pr public presentations that correspond during Satoshi actions which should make him being Satoshi very unlikely.

## James A. Donald (may be a pseudonym)
- Pro: https://medium.com/quantum-economics/i-know-who-satoshi-nakamoto-is-a3059ef02c34

## Len Sassaman
- Pros:
  - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.10257 - "Satoshi Nakamoto and the Origins of Bitcoin – The Profile of a 1-in-a-Billion Genius"
  - https://evanhatch.medium.com/len-sassaman-and-satoshi-e483c85c2b10
  - A picture attributed to Len has been widely attributed as evidence due to him having a copy of a symposium book. However, as counterevidence, the book on the picture's shelf is of the 23rd Symposium in 2002 and not the 20th Symposium from 1999. Due to the nature that many top cypherpunks would have had access to these texts over the 9 year period, I hardly count this as definitive evidence of anything. 
- Cons: Article leaves out all the evidence that doesn't point to Len including many tweets that were very critical of bitcoin. Article states that the laptops were inaccessible, there's contrary evidence that his wife Meredith was able to go through his laptops and no Satoshi evidence was found. This is disputed as there's evidence his data was encrypted with FileVault.

## Nick Szabo
- Pro: https://likeinamirror.wordpress.com/2013/12/01/satoshi-nakamoto-is-probably-nick-szabo/
- Cons: https://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2011/05/bitcoin-what-took-ye-so-long.html - Nick's personal response

## NSA
- Pro: The main crux of the NSA theory comes from the publishing of the 1996 paper "How to Make a Mint: The Cryptography of Anonymous Electronic Cash" which you can read here - https://github.com/hagrin/security/blob/master/research-papers/cryptocurrency/1996-Cryptography-Anonymous-Cash.pdf
- Cons: The paper describes a system that is more similar to David Chaum's prior attempt than it does bitcoin. 

## Paul Le Roux

## Peter Todd

- Pro: At age 15 in 2001, Peter Todd wrote the following -

## Tatsuaki Okamoto

## Wei Dai
- Pro: https://zawy1.blogspot.com/2016/05/wei-dai-is-satoshi-nakamoto.html - linguistic based analysis matching highly to Wei Dai.

## Yonatan Sompolinsky
- Pros: https://x.com/phoenix_cr47/status/1594693316624400384 - displays the technical ability
- Cons: Almost all of the references to Yonatan are thinly veiled attempts to pump an altcoin called Kaspa (KAS)

# Satoshi Facts

- Key Satoshi Identity Papers
  - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.10257 - 2022 paper by Jens Ducrée entitled (somewhat terribly) - "Satoshi Nakamoto and the Origins of Bitcoin - The Profile of a 1-in-a-Billion Genius"
- Known email addresses:
  - satoshi@vistomail.com
  - satoshin@gmx.net
  - satoshin@gmx.com (which was likely compromised / hacked)
- Possible IP used from California - https://whoissatoshi.wordpress.com/2016/02/20/satoshi-in-california/ (Archive Link - https://archive.is/3ZMRZ )
  - This is debated by Gmax here - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41794080
- The "Benelux" Reference - The 2nd reference in the Bitcoin Whitepaper references the "20th Symposium on Information Theory in the Benelux, May 1999". This reference has been highlighted by many as a key Satoshi identifier because 1) the book was allegedly only made available online starting 2020 and 2) printed copies were only made available to symposium participants and stored in university libraries. Many notable cryptographers / cypherpunks studied there.

- HSI agent Rana Saoud claims at a session that was recorded at The OffshoreAlert Conference on Financial Intelligence & Investigations on April 29, 2019 in Miami Beach, Florida that an HSI agent flew to California to meet with Satoshi.

# Satoshi Candidates

Rumored potential Satoshis. This list isn't meant to be all encompassing, but maintained because I get this question a lot. The candidates are listed in some alphabetical order. While I understand the fascination with trying to figure out who Satoshi is, understand that by publishing anything saying "X person is Satoshi" puts that person and their family in physical danger. You should use extreme caution before publishing anything that attempts to definitively identify Satoshi's identity.<br /><br />

## Adam Back
- Pro:
- Cons: At the Craig Wright trial, Adam submitted his correspondence with Satoshi into evidence - a total of 5 emails, Satoshi engaging Adam regarding a citation of his Hashcash paper and then some discussion about alternate whitepapers and the bitcoin whitepaper.

## Dustin D. Trammell

- Cons: https://blog.dustintrammell.com/i-am-not-satoshi/ - written by himself where you can download his email correspondence with Satoshi. Dustin also debunks a flawed research paper written out of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel.

## Hal Finney
- Pros:
- Cons: https://blog.lopp.net/hal-finney-was-not-satoshi-nakamoto/

## Len Sassaman
- Pro: https://evanhatch.medium.com/len-sassaman-and-satoshi-e483c85c2b10
- Cons: Article leaves out all the evidence that doesn't point to Len including many tweets that were very critical of bitcoin. Article states that the laptops were inaccessible, there's contrary evidence that his wife Meredith was able to go through his laptops and no Satoshi evidence was found. This is disputed as there's evidence his data was encrypted with FileVault.

## Nick Szabo
- Pro: https://likeinamirror.wordpress.com/2013/12/01/satoshi-nakamoto-is-probably-nick-szabo/
- Cons: https://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2011/05/bitcoin-what-took-ye-so-long.html - Nick's personal response

## NSA
- Pro: The main crux of the NSA theory comes from the publishing of the 1996 paper "How to Make a Mint: The Cryptography of Anonymous Electronic Cash" which you can read here - https://github.com/hagrin/security/blob/master/research-papers/cryptocurrency/1996-Cryptography-Anonymous-Cash.pdf
- Cons: The paper describes a system that is more similar to David Chaum's prior attempt than it does bitcoin. 

## Paul Le Roux

## Peter Todd

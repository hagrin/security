# Windows Commands

Just some really, really basic windows commands for doing some very basic security functions.

## WiFi

netsh wlan show profile - this will get you a list of WiFi networks that this machine knows
netsh wlan show profile name="WifiNetworkName" key=clear - get the WiFi network name from the prior command, then use it here to get the cleartext password
